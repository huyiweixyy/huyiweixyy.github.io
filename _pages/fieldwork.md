Guizhou/Yunnan Province
======

Guizhou and Yunnan provinces have the most extensive Middle to Late Triassic faunas in all of China, such as the Panxian Fauna, Xingyi Fauna and Guanling Fauna. Every summer, we journey to these regions to collect fossils, and the scenery there is incredibly picturesque!

Anhui Province
======

Anhui preserves a significant **Early Triassic marine reptile fauna** - **Chaohu Fauna**, which extensively preserves valuable information about the recovery of ecosystems following the major Permian-Triassic mass extinction event, which contains an abundance of ichthyosaurs and fish fossils. I frequently engage in fossil excavation and stratigraphic measurement work in this region.

Hubei Province
======
Hubei Province boasts another significant early Triassic fossil location, characterized by a high diversity of Hupeisuchus fossils, often accompanied by marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs and sauropterygians. We conduct fossil excavations at this site twice a year.
